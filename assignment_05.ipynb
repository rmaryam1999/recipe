    "In the past, we created `recipe` in Github.com and cloned (`git clone`) it to local PC.  If you recall, when you were typing `git status` into your terminal, the first line was always something like that `On branch main` and `Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'`. So now, let's explore what it means in a bit more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until now our repository had only one branch (with default name`main`) with several commits coming after the other:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `main` is typically the **default branch** name in git, and it represents the main development line of the repository. When you create a new repository, git will usually create a `main` branch by default. You can think of `main` as the local branch on your machine that you are currently working on. Please note that Github changed the `master` to be `main` recently as part of the company's effort to remove unnecessary references to slavery and replace them with more inclusive terms. Since this change is quite recent, you may notice that many reference materials/tutorials/website may still refer to this branch as `master`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `origin/main` is a branch that exists on the **remote** repository, also known as the **upstream** repository. When you clone a repository, you create a copy of the entire repository on your local machine. The `main` branch on your local machine reflects the `origin/main` branch on the remote repository. When you push changes from your local `main` branch to the remote repository, they will be added to the `origin/main` branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `HEAD` is just a reference to the default branch in the repository. This can change if the default branch is renamed or deleted. If you are tracking the remote repository, then your local `HEAD` branch will point to `origin/HEAD`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you go to your local `recipe` folder from previous assignment and type `git log --oneline` you will see the following line at the 1st line:\n",
    "\n",
    "`(HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD)`\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this line mean? It shows the relationships between the different branches and the `HEAD` pointer is a reference to the currently checked out branch or commit. It essentially tells git which branch or commit you are currently working on in your local or remote repository. The arrow symbol (`->`) is used to indicate that the `HEAD` pointer is pointing to the `main` branch. The `main` branch is the local branch you are currently working on. The comma-separated list of branches following the arrow represent the corresponding branches on the remote repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `origin/main` is the name of the branch on the remote repository that corresponds to the `main` branch on your local repository.\n",
    "- `origin/HEAD` is a reference to the default branch on the remote repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "This line essentially shows you that the `HEAD` pointer is currently pointing to the main branch in your local repository, and that the `main` branch on your local repository corresponds to the `origin/main` branch on the remote repository. It also shows that `origin/HEAD` is being tracked by your local `HEAD` branch."

    "If everyone worked on the same project at the same time, it could get confusing and difficult to keep track of who did what. It could also be risky if someone accidentally breaks the main code or deletes important work.That's where Git **branches** come in. When you create a new branch in Git (e.g. one called `shark`), your branch will not see any new changes made to the `main` branch; it will only be aware of the git history up until the point that it diverged from the `main` branch in the repository. This means that you can make changes, test new features, and experiment with new variations of the recipe on this branch without affecting the main codebase. Once you're satisfied with your changes and want to share them with others, you can merge your branch back into the main codebase. Git helps to track changes, resolve conflicts, and ensure that everyone's work is organized and synchronized.\n",
